# Enable or disable running content OCR as soon as an image is captured.
# OCR tends to be more compute intensive, especially at higher resolutions
# OCR is always run on titles to determine application name
LIVE_OCR_CONTENT=1 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable.

# Enable or disable running content OCR on unknown applications
# An unknown application is anything without a titlebar

# Binarization attempts to convert the image to black and white to simplify the OCR

# Perceptual hashing attempts to determine if the previous frame and current frame are identical using perceptual hashing
# If the frames are identical, the screenshot is not kept and OCR will not be performed
ENABLE_PERCEPTUAL_HASHING=1 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable

# Difference hashing attempts to do the same, but by comparing the difference between two frames and determining if its above a threshold

# The idea being if you've got this far down the image, there is no titlebar
TITLEBAR_COLOR_Y_LIMIT=250

TITLEBAR_HEIGHT=30 # How tall the titlebar is, used for cropping for OCR
TITLEBAR_LEFT_BOUNDARY=30 # How many pixels of the left side of the titlebar should be cropped, to remove window icons from getting caught in OCR

DEBUG=1 # Set to 1 to enable debug mode. This will write debug information to the console and the log files

# DANGER! This operation is destructive!
DEBUG_RESET=1 # Set to 1 to clear the database and screenshots folder at startup
