# Window Title Detection
###################################

# The window title method determines how the window title is extracted from the screenshot
# Valid options: kde, ocr

# KDE Method:
# Runs a dbus service at com.screendiary.bridge. It then launches a KWin script after each
# screenshot that collects the activeClient properties and sends them to the dbus service

# OCR Method:
# Scans the image from the top down for the presence of a titlebar color. If found, the image
# is then cropped and OCR is run against the cropped section. See below options for more detail

###################################
# Browser
###################################

# If enabled, ScreenDiary will attempt to extract the URL from the titlebar
CAPTURE_BROWSER_URL=1 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable

LIVE_CAPTURE_BROWSER_URL=0 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable

# When browser capture is enabled, ScreenDiary will first look through the history for an exact title match. If that cannot be found this value is used.
# This value represents how many minutes ago in the browsers history should be considered for a partial title match

###################################
# OCR
###################################

# Enable or disable running content OCR as soon as an image is captured.
# OCR tends to be more compute intensive, especially at higher resolutions
# OCR is always run on titles to determine application name
LIVE_OCR_CONTENT=1 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable.

# Enable or disable running content OCR on unknown applications
# An unknown application is anything without a titlebar
# This option is only applicable when using the "ocr" window title method
OCR_UNKNOWN_APPLICATIONS=0 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable.

# Binarization attempts to convert the image to black and white to simplify the OCR

# OCR Window Title Method
###################################

# The OCR method of window title reading works by scanning the image from the top down for the presence of the titlebar color
# This is then cropped from the top of the image to the height of the titlebar. OCR is then run against the cropped image

TITLEBAR_COLOR="#31363b" # Color of the titlebar background
TITLEBAR_COLOR_X=105 # How many pixels left the TITLEBAR_COLOR should be sampled from, needs to account for Spectacles transparent borders

# How many pixels down the image should the TITLEBAR_COLOR be looked for, any pixels beyond this will not be considered
# The idea being if you've got this far down the image, there is no titlebar
TITLEBAR_COLOR_Y_LIMIT=250

TITLEBAR_HEIGHT=30 # How tall the titlebar is, used for cropping for OCR
TITLEBAR_LEFT_BOUNDARY=30 # How many pixels of the left side of the titlebar should be cropped, to remove window icons from getting caught in OCR
TITLEBAR_RIGHT_BOUNDARY=85 # How many pixels of the right side of the titlebar should be cropped, to remove window decorations

# Duplicate Frame Detection
###################################

# The below options are for reducing the amount of processing performed by attempting to identify when the screen has not
# changed content. Unless you have a specific reason, you should stick with the default difference hashing.

# Difference hashing attempts to determine if the frame should be updated by comparing the difference between two frames
# and determining if its above a threshold. If the difference is below the threshold, the screenshot is not kept and title
# This is the fastest and most accurate of the three methods.
ENABLE_DIFFERENCE_THRESHOLD=1 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable
DIFFERENCE_THRESHOLD=32 # 0 - 64, where 64 is 100% of the pixels must have changed

# MD5 hashing attempts to determine if the previous frame and current frame are identical using MD5 hashing.
# This performs a bit faster than difference hashing, but will result in a lot of false positives, as even
# a single bit of difference in the MD5 hash will result in the frame being processed.
ENABLE_MD5_HASHING=0 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable

# Perceptual hashing attempts to determine if the previous frame and current frame are identical using perceptual hashing
# If the frames are identical, the screenshot is not kept and title extraction/OCR will not be performed
ENABLE_PERCEPTUAL_HASHING=0 # Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable
